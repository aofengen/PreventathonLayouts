# Preventathon
[NodeCG](http://github.com/nodecg/nodecg) layouts bundles for Indie Explorer League and Preventathon events. Based on No Glitches Allowed's "[Save Our Shelter](https://horaro.org/noga/saveourshelter)" repo by George. Depends on [nodecg-speedcontrol](https://github.com/speedcontrol/nodecg-speedcontrol). Major thanks to R30hedron for all his assistance.
